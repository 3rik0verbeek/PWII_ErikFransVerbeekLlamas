# Why I started this project:

This web site was elaborated as a project for the FCE course, which objective is mainly learning getting used to handle git and github, which are crucial for any code developer now a days. While also touching some html and css writing as they likely help front-end dev's but also dev's in general because of other proyects such as web scrapping.
