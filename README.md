# Personal Portfolio of Erik Frans Verbeek Llamas

## Description:

### Why I started this project:

This website was elaborated as a project for the FCE course, which objective would mainly be learning getting used to handle git and github, which are crucial for any code developer now a days. While also touching some html and css writing as they likely help front-end dev's but also dev's in general because of other proyects such as web scrapping and such.

### My website's content:

Firts of, most of the code of this website is based on a portfolio tutorial followed on youtube.

The home page of the website, index.html, has a simple structure with links to other pages set on a navbar, note that this navbar will be a common feature for all web pages. The sub pages are structured (and saved inside a public folder) as indicated on the assignment:

- Net

Includes a list with links to my fellow clasmate's websites

- About me

Consists in a breef description of Erik, a pair of pictures and some links to his friends' websites.

- Topic

Contains some content about a past project of the same subject: Ethical hacking. Including some pictures, text and references.

- Degree

Is a summary of the subjects taken in Erik's degree, dived into years and with a special link to FCE where you will find a description of the subject, an indexation of its units studied and a explanation of the practical works one and two.

Note that fundamentals.html is also a subpage of the site.

- Contact

Includes the basic fields of a usual contact form.

Aditionally, there is one css file inside the css folder which aplies styles over all pages.

## Development Problemas

I will divide the problems in two sections:

### 1.Git and github

Most of the obstacles I found along the way were related to the use of git and github, this was clearly a consecuence of my lack of expeience and knowledge of git.

Some of the problems were for instance, the non compatibility between files due to slightly difenrent names, messing up the branches because of messy instructions on git and finally some trouble with the delivery of this work. So I finally opted for starting a new repo having this in mind.

However, I used this frustration to motivate my self to learn more about git and github even furter, understanding now a better grasp of it.

### HTML and CSS usage

The issues encountered during the development sumarize in some trouble with showing certain images which I soon resolved by changing the format of the image files, and some messy code as I mixed in code forma a tutorial with some of my own. The problem was that I was not too awere of what the code I had from the tutorial did, so this led to much code being a bit confusing, but at the end I got more into this language and resolved all issues without further complication.

## Conclusions
