# Personal Portfolio of Erik Frans Verbeek Llamas

## Description:

### Why I started this project:

This website was elaborated as a project for the FCE course, which objective would mainly be learning getting used to handle git and github, which are crucial for any code developer now a days. While also touching some html and css writing as they likely help front-end dev's but also dev's in general because of other proyects such as web scrapping and such.

### My website's content:

Firts of, most of the code of this website is based on a portfolio tutorial followed on youtube.

The home page of the website, index.html, has a simple structure with links to other pages set on a navbar, note that this navbar will be a common feature for all web pages. The sub pages are structured (and saved inside a public folder) as indicated on the assignment:
